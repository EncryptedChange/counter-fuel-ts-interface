# Fuel Network contract interface

## Use the fuel-ts sdk to interface with a testnet contract

This project uses the [fuel-ts sdk](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/) to interface with the [counter contract](https://github.com/FuelLabs/docs-hub/blob/86506d59ea692fb72ceda0b5e1284b2e85cf9a84/docs/guides/examples/counter-dapp/counter-contract/src/main.sw#L22) using typescript and is designed to run in the terminal with [deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/)

For more information please refer to the [fuel-ts sdk documentation](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuels-ts/guide/contracts/methods.html)

You can interact with the already [existing counter contract](https://app-testnet.fuel.network/contract/0x2edbc4b7de15e8936f1b34fd7894325fb61ea3478a5192318c3a86188a56b1bd/transactions) in this project or deploy your own using the [SwayPlayground](https://www.sway-playground.org/)
